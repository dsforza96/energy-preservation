Use the `conductors.py`, `glossy.py` and `dielectrics.py` scripts to generate
the look-up tables containing the values of the directional albedo of
conductive, glossy and dielectric materials, respectively. You can then use
`fit.py` to approximate them with a polynomial or a rational function of the
desired degree.
